Stranger
========
Stranger is an Automata-Based Symbolic String Analysis Library. You can use stranger to solve string constraints and/or compute pre and post-images of string manipulation operations such as concatenation and replacement. It can handle complex regular-expression based replace operations such as PHP's preg_replace and approximate these operations in the presence of unbounded loops with high precision and smooth performance. It can also be used to do automatic repair for such bugs. Stranger stands for STRing AutomatoN GEneratoR.
